## General requirements

Beginning with version 5.2.6, the module allows you to connect to printers using the following connection methods:

*   [QZ Tray 2.x](https://qz.io/download/);
*   [PrintNode](https://app.printnode.com/account/download).

The requirements depend on the connection method you require:

*  For printing with QZ Tray 2.x, it is recommended to purchase QZ premium support at [http://buy.qz.io/](http://buy.qz.io/).  Most printers are supported, but it's going to depend on the printing technique. The product performs best with a series of raw printers that receive a proprietary markdown language such as ESCPOS, EPL, ZPL, DPL, FGL, etc. QZ Tray also supports standard desktop printing (e.g. inkjet, laserjet, 2d printing drivers).
For more info, see {% link "Getting started with QZ Tray 2.x" ref_lh4nFlzm %}.
*   For printing with PrintNode, you need to register an account with PrintNode at [https://app.printnode.com/account/register](https://app.printnode.com/account/register). For more info, see {% link "Getting started with PrintNode" ref_L2vV8Twt %}.

## Hardware requirements

The minimum set of hardware required to be able to use the module includes a Barcode Scanner and a Receipt Printer. Such a set will be enough for stores that identify products using the barcodes printed by the manufacturer. If you are going to print your own barcodes, you will also need a Barcode Printer.

We guarantee that X-Cart's POS system module is compatible with the following hardware:

*   [Motorola LS2208-SR20007NA Barcode Scanner](http://www.barcodesinc.com/symbol/part-ls2208-sr20007na.htm)

*   [Motorola LS2208-7AZU0100ZNA Barcode Scanner](http://www.barcodesinc.com/symbol/part-ls2208-7azu0100zna.htm)

*   [Motorola LS2208-SR20007R-NA Barcode Scanner](http://www.barcodesinc.com/symbol/part-ls2208-sr20007r-na.htm)

*   [Citizen CT-S310II-U-BK Receipt Printer](http://www.barcodesinc.com/citizen/part-ct-s310ii-u-bk.htm)

*   [Zebra	ZD41022-D01M00EZ Barcode Printer](https://www.barcodesinc.com/zebra/part-zd41022-d01m00ez.htm)

*   [Zebra 10010038 Barcode Label](https://www.barcodesinc.com/zebra/part-10010038.htm)

*   [BCI RPT3.125-STD-ECO Receipt Paper](https://www.barcodesinc.com/bci/part-rpt3.125-std-eco.htm)

It's possible that other models can be used, but the ones listed above were tested and proved to be fully compatible. 

## Installation

The module POS system for X-Cart can be obtained via X-Cart’s Marketplace. It is a commercial module, so you must purchase a license to be able to use it.

Note that the module POS system requires another module by X-Cart team to be installed and enabled - System fields. Be sure to enable this module prior to enabling the module POS system.
