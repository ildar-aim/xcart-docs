Social feeds are a good point to attract new visitors and boost sales, Facebook Marketing being one of the most popular and efficient. If you have a Facebook account, you can start using X-Cart's free [Facebook Ads and Instagram Ads](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/facebook-e-commerce.html) module (formerly known as "Facebook eCommerce") right away. This module enables you to upload your products to Facebook Catalog and to create personalized ads that will allow reaching the right audience in the right place at the right time. Facebook ads are synchronized with Instagram and are shown there as well even if you don't have an Instagram account.

You can learn more about Instagram ads [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1634705703469129?helpref=faq_content "Facebook eCommerce Module") and [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1513393428972189?helpref=faq_content "Facebook eCommerce Module").

## **Install the Facebook eCommerce module**

  ![xc5_fecommerce_module_in_mktplce.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_LA0TBHEA/xc5_fecommerce_module_in_mktplce.png)
  
Once installed the module will become available in the **Sales Channels** > **Facebook E-Commerce** section of the store admin area. 

Also, each product will gain an _Add to Facebook product feed_ setting in the Marketing section on the product details page that is enabled by default. All products with the enabled _Add to Facebook product feed_ setting will be automatically added to the product feed and uploaded to your Facebook Catalog.

## **Configure the module** 

  You can configure the Facebook e-Commerce module in the **Sales Channels** > **Facebook E-Commerce** section of the store admin area
  
  ![xc5_fecommerce_settings.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_LA0TBHEA/xc5_fecommerce_settings.png)
  
  OR by clicking the **Settings** link when the module installation is complete.
  
  ![xc5_fecommerce_settings_link.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_LA0TBHEA/xc5_fecommerce_settings_link.png)
  
  To configure the module you'll need to define the following settings:
  * Frequency of Product Feed renewal : hourly/daily/weekly
  * Facebook Pixel ID : Here you need to place your Facebook Pixel ID 
  
  {% note info %}
  If you don't have a Facebook Pixel ID yet, you can generate it as described at [https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755 "Facebook eCommerce Module"). 
  
  Facebook Pixel will allow tracking such events as _View Content/Search/Add to Cart/Initiate Checkout/Purchase_ and you can get stats on these events to work with sales funnel, ads conversion and so on.
  {% endnote %}
  
  When defined, click the **Generate Product Feed** button to get a link that you should use to upload the product feed to your Facebook Catalog
  
  ![xc5_fecommerce_generate_prod_feed_w_id.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_LA0TBHEA/xc5_fecommerce_generate_prod_feed_w_id.png)
  
  It will take some time to generate a Product Feed URL depending on the overall store inventory. When completed copy a _Product Feed URL_ that has been generated and paste it when creating a new catalog at https://www.facebook.com/products/catalogs/new.
  
  ![xc5_fecommerce_url_generated.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_LA0TBHEA/xc5_fecommerce_url_generated.png)
  
  {% note info %}
