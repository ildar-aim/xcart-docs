reCAPTCHA lets you embed a CAPTCHA in your web pages in order to protect them against spam and other types of automated abuse. 

[Google reCAPTCHA module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/google-recaptcha.html "Google reCAPTCHA ") uses the free Google reCAPTCHA service to protect your shop from robots creating fake user accounts and sending SPAM through your site.

The module integrates with the advanced version of the API that displays a simple "I'm not a robot" checkbox instead of asking users to enter a complex mix of digits and letters.

To start using the module make sure it's installed and enabled as described in {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

To configure the module open the module settings page:
