The [Market Price](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/market-price.html "Market Price") module helps a merchant to raise sales. The module allows setting a market product price, which shows the difference between the price offered in your store and the average price of the same product on the market. The market price is meant to show a customer how advantageous it is to order the product from your store.

The market price is displayed next to the regular one in a category product list and on a product details pages. A sign showing the discount produced by the price difference is shown next to it to attract customer's attention.
