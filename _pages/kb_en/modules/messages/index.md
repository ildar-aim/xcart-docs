X-Cart's addon [Messages](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/order-messages.html "Messages Module") is a solution to facilitate the communication between the customers and the seller in an X-Cart based store. 

With this addon enabled, both the customer and the seller can initiate a conversation in connection to an order right from the order details page. A well-thought-out notification system ensures that no message will be left unread.  

General information on the use of the Messages addon in X-Cart is available here:

In a Multivendor X-Cart store, the addon can be used to enable communication between the customers, the individual vendors acting as sellers and the store owner. More information on the use of the addon with Multivendor is available in the section {% link "Messages addon: Usage with Multivendor" ref_4Ox4FPDB %}.
