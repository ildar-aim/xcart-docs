## Getting notified about new messages
Whenever someone sends you a message, you will be notified about it via a bell notification in your X-Cart store's Admin area:

   ![new-mes-notification.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_09pfmGGi/new-mes-notification.png)

You can expand the bell notification menu and access your new messages by clicking the Messages link:

  ![quick-menu.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_09pfmGGi/quick-menu.png)

Note that you will also receive all the messages addressed to you via email.
