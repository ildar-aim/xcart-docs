This section covers the order related messaging features and actions available to you via your X-Cart store's Admin area.

## Getting notified about new messages and disputes
Whenever someone sends you a message or opens a dispute, you will be notified about it via a bell notification in your X-Cart store's Admin area:

   ![new-mes-notification.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_09pfmGGi/new-mes-notification.png)

You can expand the bell notification menu and access your new messages or disputes by clicking on the respective link ("Messages" or "Disputes"):

   ![msgs_bell_links.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_7KZpxV92/msgs_bell_links.png)

On the order details page, you will be able to discover new unread messages/disputes submitted with regard to the current order by looking at a small number label showing next to the Messages tab title (The number on the label will show the number of unread messages):
   
   ![msgs_new_msg.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_7KZpxV92/msgs_new_msg.png)

Note that you will also be notified about any new messages and disputes via email.


## Messages section: all your messages and disputes in one place
You can easily access all the communication threads (messages and disputes), if any, via the Messages section of your store's Admin area (**Orders** -> **Messages**):

   ![msgs_messages_in_admin.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_7KZpxV92/msgs_messages_in_admin.png)

For each communication thread, the following information is provided:
   
   * **Link**: Order # to which the communication thread pertains. 
   * **Message**: Latest message in the communication thread. New (unread) messages will be marked (See the note "New message for order" on the screenshot above).
   * **Date**: Date and time when the latest message in the communication thread was posted. 
Communication threads with an open dispute will be marked **Dispute** (in red).

From the Messages section, the following actions are available:

   * View a communication thread. To access the thread you require, click anywhere on the line of the respective conversation in the list. This will open the order details page with the full message thread pertaining to the current conversation.
   * Search for specific communication threads. Use the filter/search panel above the list to provide keywords and filter the search results. (For example, it is possible to search only in unread messages, or only in open disputes, or in all the messages regardless of the type).
   * Mark all or selected communication threads as read or unread.

## Viewing/responding to messages for a specific order
Messages and disputes associated with a specific order can be found on the Messages tab of the Order details page. You can view all the communication pertaining to a specific order using one of the following methods:

   * In the **Orders list** section (**Orders** -> **Orders list**), find the order you require and open its details for viewing/editing. Switch to the Messages tab of the order details. In the section that opens you will find all the messages pertaining to this order.
   OR:
   * In the Messages section (**Orders** -> **Messages**), locate the communication thread you require (it will have the order number shown in the **Link** column) and click anywhere on its line. You will be redirected to the Messages section of the order details with the respective communication thread.

## Contacting a customer about a specific order

## Finding orders with unread/any messages
You can easily find orders with messages using the advanced search panel on the **Orders list** page (**Orders** -> **Orders list**). With the addon "Messages" installed and enabled, this panel includes the field **Messages** which you can use to specify the filtering option you require (_All orders_, _Orders with unread messages_, _Orders with any messages_).

## Opening/closing a dispute
If necessary the store admin can open a dispute on the order (e.g. to cut into the messaging between a vendor and a customer and get notifications for this conversation) by clicking the **'Open dispute'** button in the _Messages_ tab of the Order details page and close a dispute by clicking the **'Close dispute'** button respectively.

To open a dispute it will be necessary to specify a reason for it:

![open-dispute-a.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_09pfmGGi/open-dispute-a.png)

And a dispute will be opened with a special notification on whom the dispute originates to:

![dispute-opened-admin.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_09pfmGGi/dispute-opened-admin.png)

When a dispute is closed, a special notification will be there as well:
