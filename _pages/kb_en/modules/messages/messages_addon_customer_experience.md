This section covers the order related messaging features and actions available to the customers of an X-Cart based online store using the addon **Messages**.

The addon **Messages** enables direct communication between the customers and the store owner in connection to orders. For example, if a customer needs to ask a question about their order, wants to give feedback about their order or needs to report a problem, they can use the messaging system provided by the addon to start a communication thread with the seller (store administrator). This communication thread will be linked to the order in question, so both the customer and the seller will have all the order information at their fingertips. 

To start messaging with the seller about a specific order, a customer will just need to find the respective order in the Orders section of their account information (**My account** > **Orders**) and click **Contact seller**:

All communication with the store admins and/or vendors will be registered in the _Messages_ tab of the **My Orders** section in the customer account. To view the communication it will be necessary to click on the related order number.

<div class="ui stackable two column grid">
  <div class="column" markdown="span">![mes-cust-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4mlYlOOa/mes-cust-1.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span">![mes-cust.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4mlYlOOa/mes-cust.png)</div>
</div>

Also, it's possible to get a quick access to the messages from the **My account** drop-down in the customer storefront:

![cust-drop-down.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4mlYlOOa/cust-drop-down.png)

In case a customer is not satisfied with the ordered item or with communication with a vendor or whatever else, he can open a dispute to get in touch with the store administrator. 

To open a dispute a customer should:
1. Click the **Contact seller** link opposite to the order in question
  ![contact-seller.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4mlYlOOa/contact-seller.png)
2. Click the **Open dispute** link on the Messages page
  ![open-dispute.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4mlYlOOa/open-dispute.png)
3. Specify a reason for the dispute in a pop-up
  ![dispute-popup.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4mlYlOOa/dispute-popup.png)
4. Click **'Open dispute'**

A dispute will be registered and the seller will get a notification about it:
![dispute-opened.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4mlYlOOa/dispute-opened.png)

When a customer gets a new message from the seller, there appears a special icon in the header in customer area. 

![unread-mes.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4mlYlOOa/unread-mes.png)

Also a customer gets an e-mail notification about any new message recieved:

![email-cus.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4mlYlOOa/email-cus.png)

If a customer decides to close a dispute he can click the **Close dispute** link in the related communication thread:
![close-dispute-cust.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4mlYlOOa/close-dispute-cust.png)


In a Multivendor X-Cart store, the addon can be used to enable communication between the customers, the individual vendors acting as sellers and the store owner. More information on the use of the addon with Multivendor is available in the section {% link "Messages addon: Usage with Multivendor" ref_4Ox4FPDB %}.
