Like many other X-Cart addons, the addon **Messages** has its own settings page which can be accessed via the Settings link:
   ![msgs_settings.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_7K9BOMK0/msgs_settings.png)

At the time of writing, there is just one setting available on this page, and that one is of value only to multivendor X-Cart stores running in the Warehouse multivendor mode.
