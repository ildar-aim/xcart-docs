Like many other X-Cart addons, the addon **Messages** has its own settings page which can be accessed via the Settings link:
   ![msgs_settings.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_7K9BOMK0/msgs_settings.png)

At the time of writing, there is just one setting available on this page, and that one is of value only to multivendor X-Cart stores running in the Warehouse multivendor mode.
   ![msgs_settings1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_7K9BOMK0/msgs_settings1.png)
More info on this can be found in the section {% link "Messages addon: Usage with Multivendor" ref_4Ox4FPDB %}.

For non-multivendor stores, the only thing that needs to be adjusted before you start messaging with the help of this addon is the addon-specific email notifications. To adjust the notifications, go to the Email notifications section (**Store setup** > **Email notifications**) of the store's Admin area. At present, there are two of them.
