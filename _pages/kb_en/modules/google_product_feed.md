Google Product Feed module generates a feed file to upload your store and product data to Google (and not only to it) in the correct format. You can use the uploaded data for Google Shopping and other Google services, as well as 3rd party services which accept the Google feed file format.

To use Google Product Feed make sure the module is installed and enabled as described in {% link "Activating and deactivating addons" ref_uEnDBBA7 %}.

Once enabled proceed to the module _Settings_ page.
