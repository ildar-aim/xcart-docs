The addon provides a few shipping related settings that can be adjusted for products that require shipping (You can find them in the "Shipping" section of the Info tab of a product's details): **Shipping freight**,  **Free shipping** and **Exclude from shipping cost calculation**.

The addon also has a settings page where you can specify whether the shipping cost for products with a defined shipping freight value should be calculated as shipping freight only or whether the shipping freight for such products should be added to the regular shipping rate.
