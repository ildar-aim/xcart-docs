Order Reports module helps merchants to analyze the sales return-on-investment by segmenting orders by products, categories, shipping country, etc. Hence it's possible to track where the most sales come from and get ideas about how to increase the revenue. 

Order Reports module is included in the X-Cart Ultimate edition and is a paid module for X-Cart Business and Multivendor.

Once {% link "installed and enabled" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %} the module adds the **Order returns** section to the **Orders** parts of the Admin area (**Orders** -> **Order returns**):

  * a required time period
