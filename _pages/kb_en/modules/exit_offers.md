The [Exit Offers module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/exit-offers.html "Exit Offers") allows to display an exit popup when a visitor moves the mouse up to the close button and is about to leave your site. This way it's possible to grab visitors back right when they are about to leave your store and recover sales which you would otherwise lose.

To intall the module follow directions from {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

When installed and enabled the module adds a special **Exit Offers** section in the store admin area (**Discounts** -> **Exit Offers**) where it's possible to create new and manage existing offers.
