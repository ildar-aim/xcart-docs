X-Cart is integrated with the Royal Mail (the national postal service and courier company in the United Kingdom) via the [Royal Mail Service](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/royal-mail-service.html "Royal Mail Service") module.

The Royal Mail integration module for X-Cart sends the order information to Royal Mail. There itâ€™s given a tracking ID, shipping and customs labels and RM sends them back to your store. After that, you can label the orders and print out the manifest for the courier.

To start working with the module make sure the Royal Mail Service is installed and enabled as described in {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

Make sure the "ImageMagick" library is installed on the server hosting your X-Cart store for you.
