Royal Mail is the national postal service and courier company in the United Kingdom.

The Royal Mail integration module for X-Cart sends the order information to Royal Mail. There it’s given a tracking ID, shipping and customs labels and RM sends them back to your store. After that, you can label the orders and print out the manifest for the courier.

With this module, the process of sending out your buyer’s orders is mostly automated, which saves you time for your business development.
