X-Cart's PayPal integration supports PayPal Checkout [Smart Payment Buttons](https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/what-are-smart-payment-buttons-in-express-checkout-ts2173). The Smart Payment Buttons feature enables you to customize the payment buttons on the checkout page.

With Smart Payment Buttons, you can choose:

   * The size, color, and shape of your PayPal checkout button and the buttons for other multiple alternative payment methods such as PayPal Credit, Venmo, and local funding sources.
   * The language that appears on the buttons.
   * The button layout (horizontal or vertical).
