The X-Cart module [Products Carousel](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/products-carousel.html "Products Carousel") can be used to enable a responsive and user-friendly product carousel for certain sections on the storefront (e.g. Bestsellers, Featured Products, New Arrivals, etc.) It is compatible with smartphones, tablets and desktop computers.

To install the module, follow the instructions from {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

After the module has been installed, proceed to the module settings page to configure it:

On the module settings page, you will find a list of sections for which the product carousel can be enabled:

![settings-page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4yBBezmL/settings-page.png)

Choose the sections and set the navigation method that you want to be used for them (pagination, "next-previous" arrows or both at the same time). Note that your choice of navigation method will be applied to all the sections with product carousel enabled and can't be changed on a per section basis.

**Submit** your changes to make them active.

When the product carousel option is enabled for a section it will look as follows in the storefront:

![cus-pagination.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4yBBezmL/cus-pagination.png)

Customers now don't need to scroll the screen down to see all products in the section. They can use either arrows or pagination to view them all in the same place.

Product carousel mode preserves a possibility for a customer to drag-n-drop a product to add it to cart:
