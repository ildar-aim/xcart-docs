If you want to be sure that any of your buyers has a registered profile in your store use the [Register on checkout](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/register-on-checkout.html "Register On Checkout") module.

To install the module follow the guidelines from {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

When installed, the module automatically disables checkout from unauthorised customers and engages them to register on checkout.

There a customer will have either to sign in with an exisitng account, if he has it, or register a new account if this is his first order in your store.
