[Infinite Scroll module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/infinite-scroll.html "Infinite Scroll") by X-Cart allows to replace standard pagination with Facebook-wall-like infinite scrolling that improves shopping experience and makes product browsing easier and quicker not only on PCs but also on touchscreen devices like smartphones and tablets.

Infinite Scroll module is SEO friendly. Though pager does not appear on the page, it exists in the HTML code. This allows search engines to follow pager links and index the entire list of products.

To install the module follow the deneral guidelines from {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

When installed and enabled proceed to the module settings page to configure the options:

The Infinite Scroll settings page allows to configure the following options:

![settings-page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1WLu7suL/settings-page.png)

* **Enable infinite scrolling on category pages** : If enabled more products will be displayed automatically on the category listing page as the customers scroll the page down.
* **Enable infinite scrolling in search results** : If enabled more products will be displayed automatically on the search page as the customers scroll the page down.
* **Enable infinite scrolling on brand pages** : If enabled more products will be displayed automatically on the brand listing page as the customers scroll the page down.
* **Show more products on scrolling automatically** : If this option is disabled more products are not displayed on the page as the customers scroll the page down. Instead the **Show More** button is displayed that a customer will need to click to see more products on the page.

**Submit** the settings to make them active.

That's it! The module is configured. Now your customers don't need to switch pages when looking through a long list of products. More products will be displayed automatically as they scroll the page down.
