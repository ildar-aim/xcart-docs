The [Hurry Up module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/hurry-up.html "Hurry Up!") allows to enable product page notifications like low stock alerts, recently bought products alerts and frequently viewed products alerts. The sense of urgency encourages the prospective buyers to make an on-the-spot buying decision.
