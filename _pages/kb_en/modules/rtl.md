The [RTL Languages Support module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/standard-rtl-skin.html "RTL languages support") adds right-to-left languages support into the standard X-Cart skin.

It adds an additional setting into the Languages page in X-Cart back-end (RTL). With the setting enabled for a language, the whole site will be displayed right-to-left when this language is selected in the storefront.

You can use this module to create your own RTL-skin based on default X-Cart template.

Please note: this addon is fully compatible with default X-Cart color schemes: Fashion, Digital, Noblesse, Standard, Crisp White and F2 skin. And it's easy to fine-tune to work with custom skins. If you need help adapting the module to your template, just contact us.
