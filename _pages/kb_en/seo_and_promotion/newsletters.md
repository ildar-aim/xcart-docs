Newsletters are a valuable marketing tool videly used in e-commerce, as it’s a good way to reach out to customers and prospects and boost brand awareness and promote products and services. 

If you don’t have a newsletter, here are a few reasons you should:

AWARENESS
A newsletter gives your company an opportunity to increase awareness and understanding of your products and services. Newsletter content builds an extensive picture. Customers and prospects should get a good idea of how it would be to deal with you, or to buy your products.

PROMOTION
Use newsletters to promote products and services or launch new products. Including information on special offers helps reinforce the effect of your advertising and promotional campaigns.

CONTACT
Sending newsletters at regular intervals helps you maintain contact with customers and prospects between purchases or sales calls. Your customers are more likely to continue buying from your store or ordering your services and keep on recommending it to friends if they are well informed from you. If customers buy your products infrequently, you can maintain contact between purchases so you build a strong relationship before the next sales opportunity.
