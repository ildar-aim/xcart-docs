## Coupons: Vendor experience
In a Multivendor X-Cart store with the addon {% link "Coupons" ref_3iTVKlYe %} installed and enabled, vendors can create discount coupons. The same way as an administrator, a vendor can create and manage coupons via the Discounts section of their area:
![xc5_mv_vendor_discounts.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_SwbyhUn5/xc5_mv_vendor_discounts.png)

Coupons created by a vendor are applied only to the products of that particular vendor.

Vendors can view and manage only the coupons created by themselves. In their personal Vendor area, they do not have access to any coupons that may have been created by other vendors or the store administrator.

## Coupons: Multivendor store administrator experience
The store administrator can view, edit and delete coupons created by the vendors
(Coupons created by the administrator are not visible to vendors andÂ can be applied only to the products owned by the administrator).
