## Coupons: Vendor experience
In a Multivendor X-Cart store with the addon {% link "Coupons" ref_3iTVKlYe %} installed and enabled, vendors can create discount coupons. The same way as an administrator, a vendor can create and manage coupons via the Discounts section of their area:


Coupons created by a vendor are applied only to the products of that particular vendor.

Vendors can view and manage only the coupons created by themselves. In their personal Vendor area, they do not have access to any coupons that may have been created by other vendors or the store administrator.

## Coupons: Multivendor store administrator experience
The store administrator can view, edit and delete any coupons created by the vendors. If the administrator themselves is also a vendor, they can create and manage coupons for their own products (Such coupons are not visible to vendors andÂ can be applied only to the products owned by the administrator).

If necessary, the administrator can create coupons on behalf of vendors and change the owner of any existing coupon. To do so, they need to specify the vendor who will be the owner of the coupon using the Vendor field in the coupon details:
