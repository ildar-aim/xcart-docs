The addon **[Product reviews](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/product-reviews.html "Configuring the Multi-vendor addon")** can be used to enable customers to rate products and add product reviews. In addition to that, in an online store based on X-Cart Multivendor, this addon can be used to enable customers to give a detailed categorized rating of the vendor(s) from whom they have purchased products to let other customers know about their experience. Once an order has been delivered to the customer, the customer can rate each of the vendors from which the products in the order were sourced according to the following categories:
   
   * Item as Described;
   * Communication;
   * (if applicable) Shipping Speed.
   
In each of the above named categories, the customer's experience can be specified as a rating of one to five stars. The rating info provided by different cutomers for a vendor is summed up, and the resulting rating summary is shown on the vendor page in the Customer area and in the vendor information block on the page listing the vendor's products in the Customer area.   

In this section you will find more information on the use of "Product reviews" with X-Cart Multivendor:

**Privacy and access**

   *   **Allow vendors to approve, reject and edit product ratings and reviews**: Enable this to allow vendors to handle product ratings and reviews for their products. This setting applies only if the store has product ratings and/or reviews created with the Reviews module.
