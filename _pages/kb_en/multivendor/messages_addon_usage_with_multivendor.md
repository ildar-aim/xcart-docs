If you have Multi-vendor functionality enabled, the Messages addon also allows your buyers to start messaging with sellers before they make a purchase. They can initiate the conversations right on the sellers' pages in the storefront. 

## Admin experience
If enabled and you have the {% link "Multivendor" ref_4ahg5FLK %} module enabled as well proceed to the Messages module settings page to add special options for providers:

  ![settings-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_09pfmGGi/settings-1.png)

You'll see a screen where you'll need to allow a direct communicaton between customers and providers in a “Warehouse” mode:

{% note info %}
In the “Warehouse” mode it’s a store administrator who handles communication with customers by default. If both messaging with the store administrator and vendors is enabled, a customer can choose whom he wants to communicate with.

In “Vendors as separate shops” mode vendors communicate with customers themselves and get only the messages related to their orders.
