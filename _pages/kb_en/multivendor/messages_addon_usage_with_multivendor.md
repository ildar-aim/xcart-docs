If you have Multi-vendor functionality enabled, the Messages addon also allows your buyers to start messaging with sellers before they make a purchase. They can initiate the conversations right on the sellers' pages in the storefront. 

## Admin experience
If enabled and you have the {% link "Multivendor" ref_4ahg5FLK %} module enabled as well proceed to the Messages module settings page to add special options for providers:

**Allow direct communicaton between vendor and buyer in the "Warehouse" multivendor mode**

  ![settings-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_09pfmGGi/settings-2.png)


{% note info %}
In “Vendors as separate shops” mode vendors communicate with customers themselves and get only the messages related to their orders.

In the “Warehouse” mode it is the store administrator who handles communication with customers by default. If both messaging with the store administrator and vendors is enabled, a customer can choose whom he wants to communicate with.
