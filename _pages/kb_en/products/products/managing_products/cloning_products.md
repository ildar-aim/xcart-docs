If you need to create a new product in your X-Cart store and know that you already have a similar product in the store catalog, you can create the new product by cloning the existing one. 

To create a product by cloning:

   1. Go to the Products section of the store back end and find the product that you would like to use as a basis for the new one. Select this product by placing a check mark opposite its name in the first column of the product list.
   
   2. Choose to clone the selected product with the **Clone selected** tool.
