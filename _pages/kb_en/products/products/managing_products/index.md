Usually products managements starts with adding products to catalog. This can be done either on a per product basis, as described below, or via the {% link "Import-Export" ref_TANvG2De %} facilities. 

Also you'll need to promote your products to customers and make them displayed not only on the category page they belong to. Link products with each other, so that customers could see alternatives and supplements when viewing a product they looked for. Refer to {% link "Promotional Blocks" ref_2jxmZvPp %} section to check the facilities.

When all products are added, you'll need to organize their representation in the storefront. You can choose between **Grid**, **List** and **Table** display modes and set the desired view in the store general settings (**Store setup** -> **Cart & checkout**). You can get more info on the general settings configuration in {% link "Configuring your store General settings" ref_qAZlJxZm %}.
