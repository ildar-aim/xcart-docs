Usually product management starts with adding products to the catalog. This can be done either on a per product basis, as described below, or via {% link "Import-Export" ref_TANvG2De %}. 

Also you'll need to promote your products to customers and make them displayed not only on the category page they belong to. Link products with each other so that customers can see alternatives and related products when viewing a product. See the section {% link "Promotional Blocks" ref_2jxmZvPp %} to find out more about that.

After all the products have been added, you may want to adjust their representation on the storefront. You can choose between **Grid**, **List** and **Table** display modes and set the desired view in your store's general settings (**Store setup** -> **Cart & checkout**). You can get more info on the general settings configuration in {% link "Configuring your store General settings" ref_qAZlJxZm %}.
