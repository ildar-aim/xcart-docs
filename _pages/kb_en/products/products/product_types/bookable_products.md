With X-Cart, it is possible to configure bookable products. A bookable product has all the features of a regular product, but instead of buying it your customers can reserve it for a limited time. This product model is good for booking websites and websites that need to handle online rentals/reservations.

Bookable products are enabled by the addon [Booking](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/booking.html). For more information on using this addon, see the section {% "Booking" ref_iTdd1QoP %} of this manual.
