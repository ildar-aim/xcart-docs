You can configure your X-Cart 5 store to hide the cart icon and remove the "Add to cart" and "Buy" buttons and to disable checkout turning your online store into a catalog of your goods and services. 

It's good if you need an eCommerce website to demonstrate your products and services online rather than to sell them. 

To make this possible, enable the Catalog module as described in {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}. The module is free and available for all X-Cart 5 editions (Business, Multivendor, Ultimate).

The Catalog module functionality can be extended or substituted with the following modules:
* {% link "Call for Price Module" ref_3K1pJExV %}
* {% link "Hide Prices Module" ref_46jNUlWG %}

These modules allow to hide prices but keep checkout available for customers.
