You can give certain products in your store more prominent placement by showcasing them as featured on the store's Home page or on the page of the product category to which it belongs. This feature is made available by the module "Featured Products" by X-Cart team. Before you continue, make sure this module is installed and enabled:

You can adjust the look of your featured products section on the module's settings page:

The available options are as follows:

*   Grid:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389852/8717749.png)

*   List:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389852/8717750.png)

*   Table:

To make a product "featured", follow the steps below:

1.  Decide on the location where you want the product to be showcased as featured (on a category page or on the Home page). 
    If you want the product to be showcased on the Home page, go to **Catalog > Front page**, then select the **Featured products** tab:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389852/8717633.png)
    If you want the product to be showcased on the page of a category it belongs to, go to **Catalog > Categories**, then locate the category you require and click on the category name:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389852/8717634.png)
    On the page with the category information, select the **Featured products** tab:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389852/8717635.png)

2.  In the Featured products section, click the **Add featured products** button.
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389852/8717636.png)
    A popup will be displayed allowing you to select the products that you want to be listed as featured at the selected location. 
    
3.  Select the products that you want to be "featured" and click the **Add products** button:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389852/8717637.png)
    The selected products will be added to the featured products list:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389852/8717638.png)
    Now if you check the result on the storefront you should be able to see the products you added as featured in the respective area of your chosen location (category page or Home page).
