Besides being an essential part of an online store’s branding and marketing, product reviews can definitely be a great insight into the customer service quality. They help build trust and loyalty, and typically describe what sets your products apart from others.

When used strategically, reviews can become powerful pieces of social proof that persuade people to buy. The more reviews you have, the more convinced a shopper will be that they’re making the right decision.

Reviews can help increase a store’s online presence, too. Since customer feedback appears on each product’s page, reviews can help pages be found on search engines via unique keywords.

Reviews can also help you better understand your products. If a certain product seems to get many complains about it, it might be time to get rid of that product. Stop investing in advertising and inventory for a product that doesn’t work and/or makes your customers unhappy. 

Trust indicators on your store are important and making reviews clearly available on your site can go along way towards persuading people to pull their wallets out. X-Cart has a built-in {% link "Product Reviews" ref_XBriIS6B %} module that lets you easily add product reviews to your online store. This is a great way to engage your customers and boost sales.

In addition you can use any alternative tool like {% link "Shopper Approved module" ref_1leKQurL %} or [Customer Satisfaction module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/customer-satisfaction.html "Product Reviews").

Having a way for customers to leave a review is one thing - and quite important - but getting the customers to actually leave reviews is something else entirely. On-site requests and **follow-up emails** are the most popular methods to do this. You should learn how to build email campaigns that you can send out to customers who've had the product in their hands for a week or two - this will give them enough time to learn about the product, and also to experience it enough to write a review about it. -> **Mailchimp**


Let only registered members who've purchased the product leave a review, but make it as easy as entering some text and pressing the submit button.

giving a special coupon after some submits a review might prove to be very beneficial, at the same time – discount codes, or sneak previews of upcoming products is also a great way to encourage customers to be a part of your community. 

Make leaving reviews accessible, easy and also rewarding; like setting up a coupon for $5 off for the next order! It will surprise your customer, and increase her trust in your business.
