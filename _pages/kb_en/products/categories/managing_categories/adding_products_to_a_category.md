To add a product to a category in X-Cart:

1. In the store back end, find the category to which you want to add products and to the _Product_ tab on the category details page.

2. Click the **Add product** button. You will be redirected to the _Add products_ page (**Catalog** > **Products** > **Add products**) where you can {% link "add products" ref_fhzzxDTy %} to the category one by one.

If you are going to have many products and categories, adding products to categories one by one manually via the Admin interface may take quite a while. Instead, you may want to try importing products as described in {% link "How to import data" ref_glDc6kA1 %}.
