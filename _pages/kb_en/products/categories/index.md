Categories in X-Cart stand for collections or groups of products. Products are joined into categories based on a set of similar type or product features and make it easier for a customer to navigate in your store. 

You can create categories both manually and automatically using the {% link "import feature" ref_glDc6kA1 %}.

_In this section:_

*  {% link "Managing Categories" ref_2JeiDy5a %}
*  {% link "Managing the Category Block Representation" ref_3aUJrW2c %}
