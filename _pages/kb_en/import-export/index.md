Data import is a perfect wayout if you don't have time and/or desire to populate your store with products and customers adding them manually one-by-one. It's even possible to import orders if necessary.

{% note info %}
If you want to add multiple changes to the products that are present in the database already, you might find it easier to use {% link "bulk editing" ref_1kSYmXQn %} instead.
{% endnote %}

X-Cart uses [CSV files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values "Import-Export") for data import/export that you can create in any spreadsheet editor (MS Excel _or _LibreOffice Calc_) you like better. 

Importing products is useful if you switched to X-Cart from another platform or if you want to make multiple changes to your products or inventory that are not possible with bulk editing. 

As for customers data, if you have a customer list that you want to use in X-Cart, you can enter it into a customer CSV file and then import it in your X-Cart admin. You can also use the customer CSV template to build a new customer list.

Orders import is suported via the [Orders Import ](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/orders-import.html "Import-Export") module, that is not included into the core and should be installed additionally as described in {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.
