PayPal for Marketplaces is a comprehensive payments solution for marketplaces, crowdfunding platforms, and other environments where people buy and sell goods and services or raise money. A marketplace allows buyers to purchase goods and services from multiple providers under the umbrella of a single marketplace partner. The solution is ideal if you run a multi-party commerce platform and want a flexible, end-to-end solution for processing payments.
