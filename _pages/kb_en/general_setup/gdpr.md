Since the amended [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation "Getting compliant with EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)"), commonly known as GDPR, came into force on 28 May 2018, website owners in Europe and outside it have been forced to seek ways to comply with the new requlations on processing the EU residents’ personal data (collecting emails, monitoring site visitors behavior by IP, etc).

So, to make your X-Cart 5 based website compliant with the EU legislation on GDPR, install and enable the GDPR module as described in {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

Once installed proceed to the module settings page to configure it.

You'll see a screen of the kind where it will be possible to enable displaying a cookie pop-up and edit the list of countries the cookie pop-up is displayed for.

Also you will need to implement a decent Privacy policy that will describe the policy of your store in regards to collecting customers' personal data and make sure your website visitors know where to find it. You can use a default Privacy Statement page that is added by the GDPR module or include this info as a part of the {% link "Terms and conditions page" ref_r5b4EKhF %}. It's up to you to decide what suits your business better.

The default Privacy statement page can be located in the **Content** -> **Pages** section of your store admin area.

To edit the page content click on the page name. Edit the text in the **Content** field to meet your busines needs or replace the default text completely with of your company Privacy policy instead. The rest of the canges can be done the same way as described in {% link "Adding pages to your store" ref_Ptf5vaPn %}. **Save** changes when you are done.
