Your X-Cart storefront can be finetuned for your needs by changing options in the `etc/config.php` file at the `[storefront_options] `section. Here is the reference for the available option values:

### Don't close callback endpoint when storefront is closed for maintenance.

If the `callback_opened` option is set to `On`, `target=callback` will be available for payment processing and IPN (Webhook) notifications, even when the storefront is closed.

### Optimize visible CSS loading

When the `optimize_css` option is set to `On`, X-Cart will inline all CSS styles (used on the current page) in the `<head>` tag, complementing them with the `<link>` tags for the first load only. This will allow to show the styled page as soon as possible, and then the browser cache kicks in on each consecutive load.

### Force custom state with autocompletion

This option will allow the customer to set a custom state for the countries with defined states (defined states will be available as the autocompletion for the 'State' field). 

Set the `autocomplete_states_for_countries` option to the comma-separated string of the country codes like this: `GB,US,DE`, `All` or leave empty to disable this option.
